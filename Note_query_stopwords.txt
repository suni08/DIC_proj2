Filtering the search word:
We have used "H1B" as our search word. We are searching this word in Tweets and articles in New York Times. For Twitter search, we used tweepy.
For NYT, we used nytimesarticle package. The API search of NYT returns URLs. We used BeautifulSoup to extract articles from URLs.

Removing Stopwords:
Stopwords are removed in the mapper. We used list of words provided by nltk.corpus as stopwords. Some words have been added manually to the list 
of stopwords according to the requirement of the data. The punctuations are removed using Regular expressions. The processed is further used in MapReduce.
